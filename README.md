# Introduction

The object of the project is finding lanes at driving car videos

There are some conditions to pass the project

1. Have to calibrate camera

2. Calculate curvature of lane at each frame

3. Calculate distance from center at each frame

4. Make lane class to use before detection information

5. Draw lines on found lanes and fill color inside of lines

6. Found lanes are similar to original lanes


# Background Learning

### Keras



# Approach

### 1. Just 1 perceptron and Lambda Normalization (only using center camera images)



# Results
